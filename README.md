# Zingat's Automated House Valuation Challenge

# General Information on the Project

Founded in 2015, Zingat operates as an intermediary between potential buyers and real estate offices. It serves as an online marketplace where real estate offices show their inventory and help potential buyers to make the right decision. To help both parties, Zingat considers providing right and accurate information about all aspects of real estate market as the main priority. In this regard, evaluating the value of real estates is crucial. Using statistical models, we estimate the value of real estates in our website for any interested parties. We collect relevant information from the users and provide them accurate information about their estates. For this purpose, we regularly build new and better models using new technologies in the field of data science. In order to challenge our models, now we invite you to build a better model. :) The best model will be determined by the performance and economical reasoning of the model.  

### Information about the Dataset

The dataset contains information on 225738 listings from Zingat.com. As all real datasets, the data is not clean and not ready to model. You may need to clean, remove, aggregate, or group some observations or variables. You may need to create new variables or using your economic intuition (because valuation is an economic concept after all), you can make assumptions or transformations about the data. As long as the assumptions or transformations are rational, they are valid.
